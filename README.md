# PokemonGo notifications in the background

Notify you the appearance of wild Pokemons close to a specified location, via *twitter*, email, whatsapp, etc. (So far, only twitter is supported).
* No need to install the server in cloud
* No need to open the web page to set up Notifications
* Start the service on your home computer, and go out for hunting - you will be notified on your mobile phone (e.g., your twitter App) when a Snorlax or Eevee appears.

The service is based on https://github.com/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map. Please follow its own installation guidance and then start the service as follows:

```bash
python ./runserver.py --host 0.0.0.0 \
  -a google -u YOUR_USER_NAME -p YOUR_PASSWORD \
  -l YOUR_INTERESTED_LOCATION -st 5 \
  --gmaps-key YOUR_GMAPS_KEY \
  -bn config/YOUR_CONFIG_FILE.yml
```

Only one additional argument, i.e., ```-bn```, or ```--background-notification```, followed by the configuration file of the notifiers. A sample configuraiton file can be found at ```config/notification.example.yml```.

# PokemonGo Map![Python 2.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-2.7-blue.svg)


Live visualization of all the pokemon (with option to show gyms and pokestops) in your area. This is a proof of concept that we can load all the pokemon visible nearby given a location. Currently runs on a Flask server displaying Google Maps with markers on it.

Features:

* Shows Pokemon, Pokestops, and gyms with a clean GUI.
* Notifications
* Lure information
* Multithreaded mode
* Filters
* Independent worker threads (many can be used simulatenously to quickly generate a livemap of a huge geographical area)
* Localization (en, fr, pt_br, de, ru, zh_cn, zh_hk)
* DB storage (sqlite or mysql) of all found pokemon
* Incredibly fast, efficient searching algorithm (compared to everything else available)
